## Abstract

Graph theory is helpful to understand everything about networks and modeling real problems. Therefore, it is important to tackle every knowledge needed about graphs to understand how the Capacity Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) works. Then, it is explained how to solve the base problem, which in fact is the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), by using the concepts of Hamiltonianâ€™s paths and circuits. A meta-heuristic method called Simulated Annealing (SA) will be used for its implementation, which is a method to find optimal
